- We finished off a load of DIY just in time for Christmas. After owning the house for a year, it's nice to have least done half of it. Our house is starting to feel like ours.

- At Castrooms, we had a few test parties culminating in a set from a guy who regularly plays at Notting Hill Carnival. I managed to get a pretty difficult feature working just in time. It was a great way to end the year.

- I've got more and more into RSS feeds again. I bought Reeder on macOS and iOS which is really nice, but it has a few little differences from NetNewsWire which I'm still getting used to. I've enjoyed coming back to reading blogs. It's a better way to ~doom~scroll when I'm bored. I also added RSS to this blog, if that's how you roll.

- I wrapped up work on the 16th and had grand plans of making great use of my time. Instead, I mostly played Destiny 2 and Vampire Survivors.

- I did however, add albums to [Lineup.fun](https://www.lineup.fun/), which has already came in handy for end of year lists.

Here's some things I've enjoyed

- The aforementioned [Vampire Survivors](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/vampire-survivors/9pd5bm2z8c4l). It combines the great element of idle games like [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) which [Bullet Hells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell)

- Christmas specials everywhere, but Behind The Bastard's _Keep The Yultide Gay_ chronicles pre-Christian Christmas: [Part 1](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G2lBDqN7IUhKUtwpQ4aI5?si=fc1fdd2bdeab49d3) and [2](https://open.spotify.com/episode/38NwcKm3jeOvNIpTSzv5Un?si=552ad6b39f31406a)
