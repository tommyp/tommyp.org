I'm late again, but getting better.

March started off with me going for a double 40th birthday party at a big mansion near Buxton. It's usually a wedding venue, but we set up a rig and had everyone DJing. It's not the first time I've done that, but it's a lot of fun every time. I feel incredibly lucky to be able to do that with multiple groups of friends.

## Crawl

I went on a pub crawl with some friends that I met during a lockdown. We sat at a table next to them when you could only sit outside and got chatting. We've became good friends since then. We crawled around some of my favourite spots in Hackney. Here's the list:

- [Old Street Brewery & Taproom](https://goo.gl/maps/kmGYbb3radg2dCr96)
- [Howling Hops](https://goo.gl/maps/nmJmYi8mCTxhbkP19)
- [Hackney Tap](https://goo.gl/maps/jTYx7TibXfAosKTs5)
- [Chesham Arms](https://goo.gl/maps/ErfVRX7qQjXVBGMj6)
- [Pressure Drop X Verdant The Experiment](https://goo.gl/maps/1fXJ5kaZyjZArKaU9)
- [The Cock Tavern](https://goo.gl/maps/9fwzKdmHmeaE5Ly6A)
- [Helgi's](https://goo.gl/maps/tkJcsQjpnkuwNxFi6)

Someone on the pub crawl, who was English, kept impersonating my accent. It pisses me off a lot and I fucking hate it, so I gave off to him. Luckily, my friends were on my side. They're from New Zealand and probably get the same shit too.

## Brat

Lila couldn't come on the pub crawl, but her and I went to a few of the same spots in Hackney after an amazing lunch at [Brat](https://bratrestaurant.co.uk/climpsons-arch/). We ordered some bread and when it came it turned out to be a giant slab. Everything was amazing.

## Beyond the Streets

We went to the [Beyond The Streets](https://www.saatchigallery.com/exhibition/beyond_the_streets_london) exhibition at the Saatchi gallery. I found it pretty ironic that an art gallery founded by someone who helped the [Conservative Party get elected](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/people-politics-law/howe-labour-isnt-working-did-the-job-the-conservatives) had an exhibition on hip-hop and graffiti culture.

Ignoring the hypocrisy, the exhibition was great. We went on a Friday night. It's been a while since I went to any of the art gallery or museum lates. I used to go to loads, so it was nice return to that side of culture in London.

## Work

I've been tackling some tech debt in work. Our repo is a Phoenix app which has a single page with a big React component view. I started pulling it apart into a Phoenix API and a SvelteKit app. It's going well, but Svelte has some quirks that come with the learning curve of building something large. Maybe I'll write about that more in future.

## Housekeeping

I did some tidying up round here. Changing font sizes, line length, removing the link to my Twitter, and consolidating my work and about pages. Removing Twitter was sad, but it needed done.

## ~~This~~ Next month

Since I'm technically late, I should really get started on next month now.
