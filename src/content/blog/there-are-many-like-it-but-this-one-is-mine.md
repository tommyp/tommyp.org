Like every developer these days, I'm writing more and more code using some amount of AI. Mostly with Claude Code, but sometimes with a little bit of GitHub Copilot.

I have a lot of ideas for side projects. Far too many to ship while mantaining any level of sanity. With various people I respect saying this is the future, I thought why not give it a shot on one of those ideas.

## The problem

In our home, I do all the food shopping, the cooking, and the kitchen is my domain, while my wife does the DIY. We try to be conscious of what we're eating, try to eat healthy, and avoid letting any food go out of date.

We've tried various methods of meal planning and co-ordinated shopping list, with varying success. Notion was the best until our shared account hit the maximum number of blocks. I've got my phone signed in as her Recipie Keeper account, which is _fine_, but I dislike the UI for some reason. The simplest solution has unsurprisngly overtaken Notion as the best - Apple Notes. Notes also has the benefit of syncing in the background, which is very handy once I arrive into the faraday cage of our local CostCo.

Any given week our meal plan looks something like this:

> Monday
>
> - deli meat sandwich
> - tofu and peppers stir fry with noodles
>   Tuesday
> - leftover stir fry
> - Tommy out
>   Wednesday
> - soup
> - freezer meal
>   etc etc

Nothing too rigid. Just lunch and dinner, and noting if one of us isn't around for a meal. I'll take that, look at any recipies for specific dishes that I'm cooking, and write a shopping list in the same note.

Notes works, but I need something slightly less ephemeral.

## The product

Building something more that what I'm doing with notes already, I want to add some more
