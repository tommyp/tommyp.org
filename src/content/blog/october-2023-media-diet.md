It's the perfect day for a rundown of all the spooky things I've enjoyed this October.

## Hereditary

Ari Aster can do no wrong. This one is about a family dealing with grief and the trauma that we inherit from our parents. It's surprising, interesting, and brutal. Worth not watching the trailer below just to get the full impact.

## The Fall of the House of Usher

An Edgar Allen Poe anthology meets Succession by Mike Flanagan. Haunting of Hill House is one of my favourite things Netflix has done, but I thought that everything since then has been a bit ... crap. Luckily, this time round he really smashed it. Bruce Greenwood is absolutely brilliant as a spooky Logan Roy.

## The Midnight Club

Last year's Flanagan thing that somehow I missed. It's OK and at least more interesting than some of the previous ones.

## A Quiet Place Part 2

I loved part 1. This one switches up the formula in a way that I won't spoil, but it's definitely influenced by The Last of Us.

## Old

It's been a while since I watch a Shyamalan film. I enjoyed the inventiveness and unraveling of the situation. There's a few real gruesome moments that make it extra fun.

## Cocoon

Cocoon is the new game from the designer behind the famous indie darlings, Limbo and Inside. Although not spooky, it's definitely somewhere on the spectrum of bio-mechanical HR Giger-esque body horror.

You play as an alien humanoid bug _thing_ exploring a World that contains orbs, which can contain other Worlds, which can contain other orbs, which can all effect each other.

The end of Men In Black when aliens are playing marbles with is a good comparison.

I finished it today, and towards the end it had some amazing mind bending puzzles with ingenious solutions.

## Unhonourable mentions

Insidious Chapter 2 was terrible and Malignant was so bad we turned it off after 30 minutes.
