New episodes of Black Mirror are out, and once again has some great episodes about _[Wot If Ya Mum Ran on Batteries](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wot-if-ya-mum-ran-on-batteries)_. As an anthology show, each story is separate. And many people have spotted references between episodes.

**This post contains some light spoilers for earlier episodes of Black Mirror**

It all started in _The National Anthem_ when Prime Minister Michael Callow got piggy with it. He's then mentioned in many episodes, including _Hated in the Nation_ where robotic bees cause a few issues. Those robotic bees appear in the background of _Black Museum_, which also features a whole load of other episodes. [And so on, and so on.](https://screenrant.com/black-mirror-shared-universe-connections-references-easter-eggs/).

There's one reference everyone misses, and it's from one Charlie Brooker's very early works - Nathan Barley.

In Episode 3, Nathan and Claire return from the pub to find Nathan's housemate enjoying himself with some dirty late night TV. The TV mentions the male performer by name, Rod Senseless.

And where else does Rod Senseless show up? He's the male pornstar that the UK Government try to use as a body double for Michael Callow right back in _The National Anthem_.

So not only do many episodes of Black Mirror exist alongside each other, they exist alongside Nathan Barley.

Totally fucking mexico.

- üìñ I also read This Is How You Lose The Time War. A very unusual book that didn't quite click with me at the start, but by the end I loved it. If the adaption ever gets made I'm very curious to see how it'll work.
- üìñ For the first time in many years I bought a magazine. _Side note_: there's no magazine emoji? [The Fence](https://www.the-fence.com/) is full of great articles, some funny, some depressing, and some insightful. It's got some of my favourite authors in it so I thought I'd give it a whirl and I thoroughly enjoyed it with a beer in the sun on Friday.
