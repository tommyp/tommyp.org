After moving to Walthamstow, I kept finding status of elephants all over the area. With no obvious clues to the reason or origin, it became a [real life Easter Egg](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRLEasterEggs/) in my life. I resigned myself to the fact that I would never know why or how Pink Elephants came to reside in my borough.

Eventually, I found a mural on one of the streets.

_The mysterious Elephant mural_

I still live in Walthamstow, but now nowhere near these statues. After I moved house, I eventually forgot about the Elephants. Until just recently when I cycled past the mural.

_Elephanti Sunt Personae_ led me to [We Are People](https://wearepeople.org.uk/). A guerilla art campaign to show that the consciousness of an Elephant and other species can be considered comparable.
