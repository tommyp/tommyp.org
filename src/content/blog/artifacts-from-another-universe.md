When I was 9 years old, my uncle gave me his copy of DOOM. Far below the age where it may have been appropriate, it was an introduction to Hell that I adored.

My evenings and weekends were spent trawling through corridors leaving trails of blood and guts behind me. Hoards of demons stood between me and the exit, and the only way through them was with punches, bullets, shells, plasma bolts, rockets, and [big fucking projectiles](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/BFG9000).

The vaguely satanic imagery was something I didn't see that often in Belfast during the 90s. To me, DOOM felt like a real life [Necronomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon). Dropped into the disc drive to lead me on some [Ash Campbell-esque](https://evildead.fandom.com/wiki/Necronomicon_Ex-Mortis) quest to fight the dead. Not that I had seen Evil Dead at this point, but you get the idea.

DOOM felt like something alien. Something weird. Something forbidden. It was like reality had cracked and I had something which shouldn't exist in our world.

That feeling has stuck with me ever since.

## Round the bend

I've written about the [Playdate](https://play.date/) [before](/blog/surprise-and-delight) after mine finally arrived. When it launched, it included a season of games delivered straight to the device, with 2 launching each week.

Unfortunately, the Playdate shipped in groups, so the idea of everyone playing the same 2 games each week didn't really work when everyone got their Playdates at different times.

Season 2 has just launched, and there are many Playdates in the world, so this time it's different. We're on Week 3 and there's already been some grea games (my favourite so far being [Dig Dig Dino](https://play.date/games/dig-dig-dino/)) but I want to share a surprise addition to the lineup from Week 1 - [Blippo+](https://play.date/games/blippo/)

> When the first batch of Playdates came online, something strange happened. All at once, the screens pulsed with an unusual pattern of TV static. Was it a software glitch? Or interference from a transmission coming from somewhere beyond our world?

Blippo+ is an TV channel broadcast from a planet that I think is called Blippo? Their scientists have detected something they call _The Bend_ in the space time continuum near their planet that has allowed them to broadcast their prime time content with us.

Now in Week 3 of this broadcast, it appears they are preparing a crack team of Bendonauts, completely chosen at random, to send through The Bend and make first contact with the human race.

It's full of some incredibely weird shit. Here's a rundown of the shows I've seen:

- Clone Trois - a soap opera about clones, so it's the same actor portraying 2 characters on the phone to each other
- Quizzards - a Dungeons & Dragons style role playing game but it's a quiz where instead of a dice the Dungeon Master asks the players trivia questions


## Honourable mentions

I've read some great articles recently on AI, such as:

- ðŸ”— [My AI skeptic friends are all nuts](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) went pretty viral. My view is that this is a marketing piece disguised as a hot take. It has some good points without much nuance, but the tone is deliberately colloquial in such a way to stand out. Just keep in mind that [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) has tried to position itself as the best place to run applications that require AI to work.
- ðŸ”— [Looking elsewhere](https://robbowen.digital/wrote-about/looking-elsewhere/) from Robb Owen. He articulates many of the same things I've been thinking about the race the bottom for costs, while maximising output for profit.
- ðŸ”— [AI got no taste](https://coops.dev/ai-got-no-taste) from Coops. Like him, I broadly like AI, and I agree with his take. Everything in my day job recently has been investigations and fixing bugs, rather than adding new features, so I haven't had a chance to try it on a large production codebase yet.

Other stuff, not about AI:

- ðŸ”— [Kareem Rahma of The Subway Takes](https://www.instagram.com/subwaytakes/) [interviewed](https://theface.com/culture/kareem-rahma-interview-2025-subway-takes-latest-episode-tiktok) by The Face. I love his videos, so it's nice to hear his takes for a change.
- ðŸ“º Taskmaster ~season~ Series 19. The lineup this year is absolute chaos but Jason is unbelievable.
- ðŸ“º Race Across The World has finished, and we've added so many more destinations to our bucket list from it. As a Thomas who is close with his Mum, Thomas and Caroline were lovely to watch, but really I was rooting for any of the teams this year.
- ðŸ“º The Tylenol Murders was a crazy watch. The next day I went to buy some ibuprofen from Tesco but the packet was ripped so I got paranoid and put it back.
- ðŸ“– [Party Lines: Dance Music and the Making of Modern Britain](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/party-lines-dance-music-and-the-making-of-modern-britain-ed-gillett/7415062?ean=9781529070651) is a brilliant book about how politics and raving in the UK are more intertwined than we realise.
- ðŸŽ¶ I went to the last ever Balter Festival recently, which was very silly. Musical highlights aside, they had a "throw the dildo on the Tory" game, which made me laugh a lot.
- ðŸŒ½ The Lambeth County Fair was great. We got there early enough to beat the queue for [the famous vegetable sculpture competition](https://www.timeout.com/london/news/all-of-the-best-vegetable-sculptures-from-the-lambeth-country-show-2025-061125).
