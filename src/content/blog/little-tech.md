There's been a noticeable shift over [the last two years or so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Acquisition_by_Elon_Musk) towards owning your own corner of the Internet. Besides myself, plenty of others are doing the same. [Mattias Ott](https://matthiasott.com/) even has a [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb) all about it.

Cultivating your own digital garden is one part of taking back the internet, but we're still figuring out what the post Twitter _community_ looks like.

I made friends on Twitter. It was a special place. I miss it. Like an ex that broke all our collective hearts, we're still working through that grief.

We need to try and move on - make new relationships, memories, and Internet friends.

## Blogrolling

I'm a big believer of _be the change you want to see in the world_, so I added a [blogroll](/blogroll) to my site - a place recommend some other nice corners of the Internet. I wanted to go one step further though, and shout out three moments recently when I enjoyed the web feeling a little smaller.

- One of the nicest and smartest people I've had the pleasure of working with is [Neil Williams](https://neilojwilliams.net/). Like myself, [he started blogging again](https://neilojwilliams.net/on-starting-this-24-october-2023/). He has a really interesting job working at the BFI, and writes about it regularly, so his blog his definitely worth reading. Also like myself, [he has been enjoying Cyberpunk](https://neilojwilliams.net/week-notes-3-10-march-2024/), and when reading a weeknote I was surprised to spot [my own love letter to Night City](/blog/i-love-night-city).

- After adding his site to my Blogroll, I got an email [from Jason](https://www.fromjason.xyz/) saying he loved the design of my site and thanking me for linking to his. He writes absolutely banging posts, but he wrote one recently titled [Where have all the websites gone?](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/) It hit hard. I love websites. I miss them too. [Let's make more!](/blog/lets-make-mad-shit).

- [Louis Pilfold](https://lpil.uk/) made a programming language - [Gleam](https://gleam.run/). I met Louis at a rave and recognised him from some of his talks and introduced myself. Then, a few weeks ago, I went to the first Gleam London meetup, which was also around the time Gleam reached 1.0. Everyone there was super nice and interesting. Being there at the start of the a programming language felt monumentous. Louis is a very cool person, but even cooler is that I know someone who made a programming language! How cool is that!?

Twitter was _the_ townsquare, and for better or worse, became a de-facto place where the Internet community gathered.

Hopefully our websites bring us back together again.

## Other things

We're planning our Wedding, a cruise, a holiday in Miami, and a garden renovation. All in the next 4 months. No sweat.

- üì∫ The Scoop was a wild watch. I love a good story about how massive pieces of shit the Royal Family are.
- üì∫ Still MAFS Australia. A facsinating insight into the human condition of wanting love _and_ terrible plastic surgery.
- üì∫ Taskmaster season 17 is off to a strong start. I'm cheering on Joanne McNally for Ireland, but John Robins and Sophie Willins are cracking me up.
- üì∫ Big Mood on Channel 4. Real life besties Nicola Coughlan and Lydia West play fictional besties hanging around Hackney while Coughlan's Maggie deals with being constantly on the verge of a mental health crisis. Funnier than it sounds.
- üéôÔ∏è [Joanne McNally's podcast on the Avril Lavigne doppelganger theory](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0hm63nc) has been cracking me up. She's hilarious, and the levels she goes to made me laugh out loud.
- üéô BBC Sounds really smashed the recommendations with [The Bomb](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08mdypb). I listened to season 1 in a few days. It follows the story of [Leo Szilard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Szilard) and his role in the creation of the atomic bomb. It's made by someone whose grandfather worked on the Manhattan Project, so it grapples with that too.
- üçø Both the old and the new Roadhouse films. Equally good and shit in different ways.
- üçø The Antisocial Network was crazy. Who would've guessed the history of the US pivoted at an anime convention.

- üéÆ [Under the castle](https://dani-diez.itch.io/under-the-castle) on the Playdate is such an addictive little game. It's interesting to see how developers approach making games with such limitions.
- üéÆ Dipping back into Halo: Infinite for The Yappening event. Fighting waves of Grunts is total carnage, and they're surprisingly difficult for the lowest level of the Banished hierarchy.
- üéÆ Game Pass added Shadow of the Tomb Raider, so I got around to playing the previous game, Rise of the Tomb Raider. It feels like a mix of The Last of Us and Uncharted. A lot wonkier than what Naughty Dog might put out, but it's scratching that itch.
