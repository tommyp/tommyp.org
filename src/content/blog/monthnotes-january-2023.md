Yeah, yeah. I realise I'm late.

## New Year's Eve

I played a gig on New Year's Eve in the basement of an Italian restaurant in Stoke Newington. It's been a while since I played in front of big crowd that included people that I didn't know, which was pretty exciting.

Although it was a private party organised by friends, we could invite other sound people that we knew. The bit of London and the UK rave scene that I inhabit isn't that large and people are pretty dedicated. It was a nice surprise to see a lot of familiar faces that I didn't know were coming, including a few that don't live in London.

You can listen back to the [re-recording](https://soundcloud.com/syntax-terrorist/live-rave-against-the-machine-nye). Re-recorded only because when I listened back to it some of my mixing was dodgy. Playing at 3am on NYE will do that to you.

It made me realise how much I miss DJing. This year, I'm going to try and do more of it. I've already got two more gigs lined up at friends birthday's.

## Countryside

My partner had to go in for some surgery at the end of January, which necessitated self isolating for two weeks in advance. Before that, we went out to a little Airbnb near Thetford Forest with a hot tub which was great, until the hot tub broke on the 1st full day we were there. It was a little shepherd's hut on a lake inhabited by a few ducks and a very aggro swan.

Some photos from the trip

## Misc

I got a new tattoo. It's a skeleton at a rave. It's not exactly how I imagined it, but I love it. It's a fun design that mixes old styles with something new and weird. It's meant to be two-partner. It's on the back of my right leg and was super painful near the top, so I might wait a bit for the next one.

## Watched

- Glass Onion - like everyone else
- Am I Being Unreasonable? - I love Taskmaster and Daisy Mae Cooper was new to me when she was on it. This is a comedy, but with some hard hitting dramatic stuff and a few twists and turns.
- 10 dollar death trip - a brutal documentary about the fentanyl crisis in Vancouver
- White Lotus S2 - Hard to compare it to the first season, but it stands almost as well by itself. _The Sopranos_ was one of our lockdown watches, so it was nice to see Michael Imperioli show up in something else.
- The Batman - a decent take on Batman's more detective side and I enjoyed it way more than any of the Marvel stuff that I've watched recently.
- Banshees of Inisherrin - Absolutely incredible. The dialogue is pitch perfect for the way Irish people talk to each other.

I'm trying to log all the films I watch on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/tommyp/). Follow me if you're on there.

## Read

- After buying the book in September, I finally made an effort to start reading Dune. I listened to the audiobook years ago, but I wanted to try and finish the book before part 2 of the film comes out. There's some scenes I remember in the book that weren't in the film that focus in on the scarcity of water, but the film gets that point across in other ways.
- [The disappearance of the ashtray](https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-disappearance-of-the-ashtray-4badc1be9e3b) is an article about a class of object that took on an artistic look, but is no longer present in modern life. When I was at the British Library in Euston for the first time I saw wall of shelves separated by vertical panels. Only when I walked past them a second time did I realise they were phone booths. I find remnants of previous human behaviour like that really interesting.

## Played

- After giving Elden Ring a second chance I'm really enjoying it. I asked some friends for advice on getting good and picked up a new character that I made previously. It turns out when you understand the mechanics for a game that complex it actually becomes fun.
