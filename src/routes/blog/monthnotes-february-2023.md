My partner had surgery had the end of January, so her and I have been taking it easy.

## Bread and beer

I had a bread making class right at the start of the month at [ProCook](https://cookeryschool.procook.co.uk/) in Tottenham Court Road. Like everyone, I tried making sourdough bread during a lockdown. The crust came out perfect, but inside wasn't cooked. I didn't want to make a fresh loaf of bread every day so there wasn't much point in trying keep a starter going. We made 4 different types of bread, so this weekend I tried making bread again and it came out fantastically. Expect more bread chat in the future.

Straight after the bread class I met some ex-Deliveroo folks for drinks at one of our old haunts. It was nice to catch up with people and see familiar faces. I worked there for 5 years and some of those people I haven't seen since they left, or when I left in 2021. I also highly recommend showing up to the pub with a rucksack full of freshly baked bread to share with people. You'll be very popular.

## Cabin fever

Now that I'm working from home 100% of the time, I'm starting to go a bit spare. Being at home so much over the last few weeks hasn't helped much either. I'm trying to get out of the house and Walthamstow at least once during a weeknight and at the weekends too. It's hard to work anywhere except my home office as the product I'm building at CastRooms needs a decent Internet connection for me to test video and audio. Doing a mic check in a café might not go down too well.

Our founder and I went to an electronic music conference called AVA at The Printworks. I loved the conversation with [David Rudnick](https://davidrudnick.org/). He's one of my favourite designers working right now so it was a nice surprise to see him on the lineup. I've been at The Printworks for some events and even a conference and work afterparty. It's a cool place, but such a huge cavernous warehouse used for dancing crowds that a few people sat on deck chairs left the space extremely cold. We left early to go and sit outside a pub in the Sun to warm up, even with it being 4 degrees celsius outside.

## Travels

We planned a holiday to Vietnam, but we've had to cancel it. Luckily we're getting a full refund so we aren't down anything to cancel it. Immediately after we were meant to get back I was flying to Portugal for Elixirconf EU. Instead, she's going to fly to Lisbon and meet me. We're going to spend a lazy week hanging out in Lisbon, which will be lovely.

## Busy, busy

I've started a big burst of tech debt tackling in work, which I'll be writing about soon. I'm getting to use SvelteKit and Elixir, because I get to decide what to use. It's a learning experience for sure, but a fun one.

I want to write more here, which I failed on this month, but on advice of [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/just-post/), I'm trying to find some process that works. Collecting ideas and setting aside time is my first attempt, so I'll see how that goes.

## Read

- [An introduction to Class Warfare for the Software Engineer](https://medium.com/@lloyd-f-hough/an-introduction-to-class-warfare-for-the-software-engineer-1810833055d7) - many of my friends of been laid off and some of those are joining unions, so this article was a great read.

## Watched

- Welcome to Chippendales (Disney Plus) - I had no idea how much crime was involved in the story of a male stripping empire. A great watch, and listening to the podcast after it was fun too.
- The Last of Us (NowTV) - It's fantastic. Bella Ramsey is great.
- The Gold (BBC) - The true story of the biggest robbery in the UK by the 80s. A fun watch of cops and robbers trying to outsmart each other.
