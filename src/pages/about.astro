			I'm from Belfast and live in London. I haven't lost my accent. You can usually spot me by my
			red hair and beard.

			I'm a huge fan of electronic music and sometimes DJ as <a
				href="https://soundcloud.com/syntax-terror-exe">Syntax Terror</a
			>. I like to spend my Summer at music festivals.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also like art, design, brutalism, mid-century modern architechure and furniture, colourful
			things, fancy <s

			> trainers, interesting indie videogames, and a lovely pint in a lovely pub.

			I've worked in tech at big and small companies for over ten years. Most recently at <a
				href="https://www.getsona.com/">Sona</a
			>. I previously worked at <a href="https://castrooms.com">Castrooms</a>, <a
				href="https://deliveroo.co.uk">Deliveroo</a
			> and the
			<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service"

			I've built some things just for me that other people use, like <a
				href="https://www.lineup.fun/">Lineup.fun</a
			>
			 and <a href="https://www.isitshortsweathertoday.com/">Is it Shorts Weather today</a>.
		</p>

		<p>I like building fun things for users that solve interesting problems.</p>
